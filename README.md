# ClarityScan: Medical Deep Learning Project

![Screenshot 2024-03-12 004645](https://github.com/raj-pulapakura/ClarityScan/assets/87762282/e56b9135-0c65-42d7-910c-a7bc4ead6615)

ClarityScan is an app that enables radiologists to enhance brain MRI scans and easily identify glioma tumors in the scans.

ClarityScan is currently powered by two deep learning models:
- Noise Removal Model: removes static noise from an MRI scan
- Tumor Segmentation Model: identifies exactly where the glioma tumor is in the scan
